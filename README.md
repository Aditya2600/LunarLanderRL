# Lunar Lander Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a reinforcement learning agent for the Lunar Lander environment using PyTorch and Gymnasium.

## Overview

The goal of the project is to create an AI agent that can learn to land a lunar module on the moon's surface safely. The agent is trained using Q-learning techniques.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Gymnasium (with Box2D)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to install the required packages. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install gymnasium
pip install "gymnasium[atari, accept-rom-license]"
pip install gymnasium[box2d]
pip install torch
